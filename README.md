# Welcome to my Custom Neovim Config.


## Here is a brief Overview and Thoughts 

I currently was cosidering making the leap from VSCode due 3 main factors. 

1. I kept running into issues while using VSCode. Such as my "VIMMOTIONS"  
package kept failing and not working after extensive use. Also, my files were 
being deleted and I couldnt figure out of to get them back. So After about weeks research
of other IDE's. I decided to give neovim a shot. 


### Whats in it? 

Well its a Custom config build with the Lua language. 
It comes with 
-LSP
-Auto Complete
-Custom DashBoard 
-Simplistic and Intuitive key motions. 
-Tmux 
-Icons and Several Colorschemes you can choose from !
