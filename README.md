### Will add a file to add to .tmux.conf so you can already get you going


## Here is a brief Overview and Thoughts 

####  Why the Switch from VSCode! 


 I kept running into issues while using VSCode. Such as my "VIMMOTIONS"  
package kept failing and not working after extensive use. Also, my files were 
being deleted and I couldnt figure out of to get them back. So After about weeks research
of other IDE's. I decided to give neovim a shot.
 

 By taking away from many good inspirational ones like the "ThePrimeagen","CraftzDog(Takuya)","AstroVim","NVCHAD". 
I was able to construct my own custom config!âœ¨




### Whats in it? 

Well its a Custom config build with the Lua language. 
It comes with 
- LSP
- Auto Complete
- Custom DashBoard 
- Simplistic and Intuitive key motions. 
- Tmux 
- Icons and Several Colorschemes you can choose from !

# Big Note "-" represents its a binding and "+" represents the combination


## Some Basic Key Bindings  


- SpaceBar - e = "Open Side Panel and Close Side Panel"

- SpaceBar - f = "Opens the Find File"

- Control - *Neovim's motions = "Toggle Through the windows"

## When using Tmux


- Control - SpaceBar - Shift + %  = Horizontal Split

- Control - SpaceBar - Shift + ""  = Vertical Split 



## Thank you so much ! Please dont forget to give me a star and feedback good or bad! If you spot any problems please let me know so I can work on it immediately. This is truly a work in progress. That will I continually update and build-on.
